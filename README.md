# Automations

In this exercise we were required to write a production management software for a BGU Drinks beverage manufacturing plant in LabView automation program. The purpose of the software we wrote is to handle the entire production chain of the plant - and in particular 3 main axes: order handling, raw material management, and the order production stage. The program met the purpose of the project - and is to create a comfortable environment for handling and constantly updating the procedures in the factory, while maintaining smart, synchronized and efficient information. The program allows easy access for the user, while handling errors and end cases.
